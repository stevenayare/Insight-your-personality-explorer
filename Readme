Personality Test App
This is an Android application that asks the user a series of questions to determine their personality, and saves the result in a Firebase Realtime Database. The app is built using Java for the backend and XML for the frontend.

Setup
To run the app, you'll need to set up Firebase and configure the app with your own Firebase project.

Firebase Setup
Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.
Follow the instructions to add Firebase to your Android app. You'll need to download the google-services.json file and add it to your app.
In the Firebase console, enable the Realtime Database.
Create a new database and set the rules to allow read and write access to authenticated users.
App Configuration
Open the project in Android Studio.
In the res/values/google_maps_api.xml file, replace the google_maps_key value with your own Google Maps API key.
In the app/build.gradle file, replace the applicationId with your own package name.
In the app/build.gradle file, add the following dependencies:
arduino
Copy code
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-database:20.0.0'
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:20.0.0'
In the AndroidManifest.xml file, add the following permissions:
php
Copy code
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
Run the app and make sure it compiles without errors.
Usage
When the app is launched, the user will be presented with a series of questions. Each question has several options to choose from. When the user has answered all the questions, they will be shown their personality type based on their answers.

The user's answers and personality type are saved in the Firebase Realtime Database. To view the data, go to the Firebase Console and navigate to the Realtime Database section. You should see a new entry with the user's ID and their answers.
